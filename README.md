## 🧠 Project Overview

This project implements two distinct methods to automate lighting:

1. **Sound-Activated Lighting** using a **KY-038 microphone sensor**.
2. **Motion-Activated Lighting** using an **HC-SR04 ultrasonic distance sensor**.

Lights are triggered in real-time based on environmental input, providing a hands-free, intuitive lighting experience.

## 🔊 Sound-Activated Lights (KY-038)

- Uses the **KY-038 microphone module** to detect claps or sharp noises.
- When a sound above a predefined threshold is detected, the microcontroller toggles an LED.
- Great for hands-free activation in dark rooms or when reaching for a switch is inconvenient.

---

## 🚶‍♂️ Motion-Activated Lights (HC-SR04)

- Uses the **HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor** to detect the presence of a person.
- Measures distance from the sensor to detect movement in a specific range.

---

## 🔧 Tools & Components

- **Arduino Uno**
- **KY-038 Microphone Sensor**
- **HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor**
- **LEDs**
- **Resistors, Breadboard, Jumper Wires**
- **Arduino IDE**

## 🛠️ Future Improvements

- Add adjustable sensitivity for sound detection.
- Integrate with smart home platforms (e.g., Home Assistant).
